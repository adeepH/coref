#### Some common issues
1. The project requires tensorflow v1, which is very much outdated. Recommend rewrite to upgrade to tf 2
1. If you need to run it regardless make sure python version is 3.6 or 3.7, can use conda to create a new venv with python=3.7
1. Try to install requirements one by one trhough conda in a new venv instead of pip'ing the requirements.txt
